So below are the steps to when you set up your docker for the first time

1. you install docker they have every OS taken into acc so go here https://www.docker.com/
2. once you do go to dev environment and click create environment and the screen below should pop up

4. Now just wait for the set up to finish and it should open vscode or your IDE of choice i am doing mine to 
    vs code
5. After setting that up install the below extension it will help with the development and also you can keep the 
    app quarantined

6. First run ```apt-get update && apt-get install make```
7. Then ```apt-get update && apt-get install build-essential```

Once you set these up you can run your c code smoothly and testing can be done fast

Also you might wonder why i made you install make

the wonder of make is that you can keep retesting code wayyyyy faster than if you would type out the commands

just treat the stuff under all as the stuff you would type in the terminal. 

For openMPI, POSIX for next sem it will be hella easy to do thread testing, since you can test multiple variations
at once, note the make file works for most things including running some python scripts so have fun with it
